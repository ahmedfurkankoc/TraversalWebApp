# Traversal Web App

Traversal is a web application developed for travel agencies. I developed this application using ASP.NET Core 8 and adhered to the principles of N-Tier Architecture. I created this side project for learning purposes. My main focus was on functionalities, so there might be some UI/client-side issues.



##  What I Learned
During this project, I've picked up important skills and a better understanding of complex ideas, which improved my logical thinking.


### `EF Core:`
I have learned the logic and critiques of Entity Framework. I gained a deeper understanding of what DBContext represents, how relationships should be established among entities, and the process of setting up migrations. Additionally, I learned how to configure EF Core in more detail.


### Overall
Each part of this project helped me understand more about building apps, managing complex information, and improving user experience. It was more than just making a web app. It was about solving problems, learning new things, and improving my skills for future work.
